While Meta ultimately blocked Signal's ad campaign, the messaging app successfully
drew attention to the issue of online privacy and drove user growth for its platform.

1. Picking a fight with the status quo can be an effective way to differentiate your brand.

4. Seize the moment. Signal's ad campaign came at a time when many consumers were already concerned about online privacy and looking for alternatives to mainstream social media platforms. By capitalizing on this moment, Signal was able to drive user growth and establish itself as a viable alternative to apps like WhatsApp and Meta Messenger.

5. Take a bold stance. Signal's campaign demonstrated that taking a bold stance on a controversial issue can be an effective marketing strategy. By positioning itself as an enemy of Meta's data collection practices, Signal gave people a reason to rally around its brand and join its movement for greater online privacy.
