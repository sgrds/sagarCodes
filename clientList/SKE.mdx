SKE is a wholesaler of plumbing instruments, offering a wide range of high-quality tools for professionals and businesses. With a focus on durability, SKE provides pipe cutters, soldering tools, and more. Trusted by plumbers, contractors, and supply stores, SKE delivers excellence and reliability.

During my time as a freelancer at SKE, I took on the role of a dedicated Full Stack developer, creating a custom inventory management software. I delved into their operations, devising a personalized system to simplify SKE's inventory tasks. Working closely with the team, I turned intricate requirements into an easy-to-use solution. Watching the software elevate SKE's efficiency and organization was truly gratifying, underscoring technology's potential to transform businesses.
