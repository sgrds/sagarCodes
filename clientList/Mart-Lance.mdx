Mart Lance is a food delivery app that connects you to a wide variety of restaurants in Kolkata, India. You can order food from your favorite restaurants with just a few taps on your phone. Mart Lance offers a variety of features to make your food ordering experience as convenient as possible, including a wide selection of restaurants, order tracking, cashless payment options, and discounts and promotions.

At Mart Lance, I succeeded as a freelancer, doing well in both frontend development and graphic design. By combining code with creativity, I made attractive user interfaces and compelling graphics. This experience not only improved my skills but also encouraged teamwork and innovation in the group.
