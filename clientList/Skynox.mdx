Skynox Tech is a software development company that provides a wide range of services, including website development, mobile app development, and graphic design. They have a team of experienced and talented developers who are committed to providing high-quality services to their clients. Skynox also run Team XenoX, a fully independent open-source division with 30+ developers coming from diverse backgrounds all over the world.

During my enriching 3-month internship at Skynox, I immersed myself as a full-stack developer, gaining hands-on experience with technologies like Next.js and React. I delved into maintaining ongoing projects and implementing novel features, honing my skills in the process. The dynamic environment provided a fertile ground for learning, enabling me to grasp intricacies of real-world development. Collaborating with the Skynox team, I absorbed invaluable insights into project management and efficient coding practices. This internship was an instrumental chapter, equipping me with practical knowledge and a deeper understanding of software development processes.
