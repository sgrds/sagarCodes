Medway Medicare is an online e-commerce platform for surgical instruments. They
offer a wide range of high-quality surgical instruments at affordable prices,
trusted by professionals and used by many hospitals in India and Bangladesh.

During my time freelancing for Medway Medicare, I took on various roles: Full Stack developer, graphics designer, and content writer. I led the creation of a surgical instrument e-commerce platform, blending my skills for a seamless user experience. By collaborating with the Medway team, I unified complex elements into a cohesive digital setup. This experience enhanced my skills and showcased how integrating technology, design, and content can empower specialized businesses like Medway Medicare in the digital landscape.
